I changed direction multiple times- I went from wanting to use a map view to display location, to deciding the map wasn't accurate, to deciding that it was accurate. So now I am using a map view

This lays out my plan:

What works:
- creating user/logging in
- adding friend/groups
- putting friends and groups to database
- checking where your friends are in My Friends tab
- updating your location


still needs to be done:
- convert altitude to corresponding floor
- UI
- how often to check location

- sharing to a certain group (deciding whether I want to keep this)
- floors tab, showing who all is on each floor (deciding whether I want to keep this)
